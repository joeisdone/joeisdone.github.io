# Age breakdown
If you haven't read the original article behind this blog, please [do so now](https://joeisdone.github.io/) - or read the [comic version](https://joeisdone.github.io/comic.html).

## Update for 5-Oct
First, an update for 5 October. I don't make many updates to this blog because, among other reasons, the premises to the blog still hold true.

I have a model which assumes a linear increase of VBM requests based on a 7-day rolling average. 

![Updated projections](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/updated-projections.png)

In the above image, the actual numbers are the solid lines, the projections are dashed lines. The trend has changed little since I began this blog; the numbers have been around VBM requests matching 40% of 2016 turnout for Democrats, 20% for Republicans, and 42% for Independents. 

(The higher turnout for independents is likely a simple function of new NC residents being more likely to register independent; see [this post.](https://joeisdone.github.io/independents.html))

Little has altered this model. Requests sped up a bit for Republicans and Democrats in the wake of RBG's death but slowed down quickly. Here are where the numbers stand: 

|   | 2020 NC VBM target to match 2016 | Original Projection | 5 Oct Update  | Gap |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Democrats  | 936,296  | 761,992 | 717,971 | -218,325 (Severely underperform) | 
| Republicans | 282,911  | 288,630 | 305,380 | +22,469 (Outperform) |
| Independents  | 430,758  | 513,106 | 531,316 | +100,558 (Well Outperform) |

*Yes, that's right, the numbers have worsened for Biden since I started tracking this model!*  
  
Now, that being said... if I think like a Democrat, I would be pivoting my focus to voter suppression, and **attempting to discourage Election Day turnout.** 

That, sadly, is easy to do in the COVID-19 era between staffing issues, facility capacity requirements, and social distancing. 

Imagine this: Fewer polling stations are set up, to limit exposure to government workers. Only five people are allowed in a building at a time. People are mandated to be 6 feet apart in lines.  
  
The result? **Long lines despite a low turnout.** Lines snaking for blocks and blocks. My recommendation, therefore, is the **GOP do everything to mitigate long lines** - whether by messaging, offering placeholders, early voting drives, etc. 

Anyway... onto the age and gender deep dive.  

## Democrats

![2016 Democrats by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/2016-democrat-age.png)

We start off by analyzing 2016 as a comparison point. In NC, there is a big asymmetry for age and gender among Democrats - Democrats tend to be overwhelmingly women, and tend to be older. 
![2020 Democrats VBM requests by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/vbm-democrat-age.png)

Democratic VBM requests are heavily female, and as expected, significantly older than the 2016 crowd in general. 

One important thing to keep in mind is Simpson's Paradox - as explained in the original blog, there exists a large number of older NC voters who will *identify as Republican* but are *registered Democrat*. It is difficult to suss out if these voters are "true Democrats" or "Republicans who never changed their party affiliation."
![2020 Democrat returns by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/returned-democrat-age.png)

What about VBM requests? Well, a good chunk of them (34.3%) have already been returned. But once again we see an even deeper age and gender asymmetry - the *returned ballot* makeup is overwhelmingly older, with over 50% of all returned ballots being voters 65+ and <5% from those 25 and under. 

## Republicans

![2016 Republican by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/2016-republican-age.png)

What about Republicans? Surprisingly, registered Republicans are much more balanced in gender compared to Democrats. They are a bit older than Democrats but not overwhelmingly so. 

![2020 Republican VBM by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/vbm-republican-age.png)

With VBM requests, we see a little asymmetry - significantly more 65+ Republican women request VBM ballots than Republican men. 

![2016 Republican by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/returned-republican-age.png)

In terms of returned ballots - hoo boy. It's overwhelmingly older people returning them. The enthusiasm for returning them is somewhat lower than Democrats, standing at 28.4% of all outstanding ballots so far. 

## Independents / Unaffiliated 

![2016 Independents by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/2016-independent-age.png)

Independent voters have the most balanced "pie" of all three parties. They tend younger and slightly male. 

![2020 Independent VBM by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/vbm-independent-age.png)

Again, we see with independents that the VBM requests tend to make up an older portion, but not overwhelmingly so. 

![2020 Independent returned ballots by age](https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/returned-independent-age.png)

In terms of returned ballots, independents are the youngest group. Whereas both Republicans and Democrats have fewer than 5% of their returned ballots from ages 25 and under, 7% of returned independent ballots are from voters 25 and under. Correspondingly, independents are the only party where those 65+ are not a majority of returned ballots.

Tune in tomorrow where I do an analysis of VBM returns together with voter history.
