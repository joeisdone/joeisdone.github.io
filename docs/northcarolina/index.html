<h1>North Carolina voting statistics</h1>

<span style="background-color:#faffc4;"><b>Have patience, please do not refresh!!!</b></span> North Carolina updates
its data once-daily and does not push out continuously like Florida SOS does.
<br /><br />
<span style="background-color:#faffc4; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">This map is meant to explore demographics,
	not serve as a 100% accurate count. Here's why:</span> <br />
The map is compiled from the entire NC voter history records, which is not always consistent.<br /><br />

<a href="https://twitter.com/DataRepublican">How this map was implemented.</a> It took me a long time just to figure
out how to encode the entire 5+gig NC voter history on the client - so it'll be a little slow.<br />

Alter checkboxes to enable filtering over demographics. Multiple checkboxes within a category act as inclusive
operators.<br /><br />

<b><span style="background-color:#faffc4;">NOTE: Not every category adds up to 100%!</span></b> (E.g., many voters do
not give out demographic data.) This is why "all categories checked" will look different than "none checked."
<br /><br />

<span style="font-size: larger;">Defaults to "Advantage Split" view where you see comparative advantage versus
	2022.</span><br />
