TITLE XIII—SECURING SEMI-

CONDUCTOR SUPPLY CHAINS

ACT OF 2024


SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Securing Semicon-
ductor Supply Chains Act of 2024’’.

SEC. 1402. SELECTUSA DEFINED.
In this title, the term ‘‘SelectUSA’’ means the
SelectUSA program of the Department of Commerce es-
tablished by Executive Order 13577 (76 Fed. Reg.
35,715).


SEC. 1403. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Semiconductors underpin the United States
and global economies, including manufacturing sec-
tors. Semiconductors are also essential to the na-
tional security of the United States.
(2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought
about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other com-
plex factors impacting the overall supply chain, has
threatened the economic recovery of the United
States and industries that employ millions of United
States citizens.
(3) Addressing current challenges and building
resilience against future risks requires ensuring a se-
cure and stable supply chain for semiconductors that
will support the economic and national security
needs of the United States and its allies.
(4) The supply chain for semiconductors is
complex and global. While the United States plays
a leading role in certain segments of the semicon-
ductor industry, securing the supply chain requires
onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable seg-
ments, such as for—
(A) fabrication;
(B) advanced packaging; and

(C) materials and equipment used to man-
ufacture semiconductor products.
(5) The Federal Government can leverage for-
eign direct investment and private dollars to grow
the domestic manufacturing and production capacity
of the United States for vulnerable segments of the
semiconductor supply chain.
(6) The SelectUSA program of the Department
of Commerce, in coordination with other Federal
agencies and State-level economic development orga-
nizations, is positioned to boost foreign direct invest-
ment in domestic manufacturing and to help secure
the semiconductor supply chain of the United States.

SEC. 1404. COORDINATION WITH STATE-LEVEL ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS.
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA
shall solicit comments from State-level economic develop-
ment organizations—
(1) to review—
(A) what efforts the Federal Government
can take to support increased foreign direct in-
vestment in any segment of semiconductor-re-
lated production;

(B) what barriers to such investment may
exist and how to amplify State efforts to attract
such investment;
(C) public opportunities those organiza-
tions have identified to attract foreign direct in-
vestment to help increase investment described
in subparagraph (A); and
(D) resource gaps or other challenges that
prevent those organizations from increasing
such investment; and
(2) to develop recommendations for—
(A) how SelectUSA can increase such in-
vestment independently or through partnership
with those organizations; and
(B) working with countries that are allies
or partners of the United States to ensure that
foreign adversaries (as defined in section
8(c)(2) of the Secure and Trusted Communica-
tions Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C.
1607(c)(2))) do not benefit from United States
efforts to increase such investment.


SEC. 1405. REPORT ON INCREASING FOREIGN DIRECT IN-

VESTMENT IN SEMICONDUCTOR-RELATED

MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION.
Not later than 2 years after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA,
in coordination with the Federal Interagency Investment
Working Group established by Executive Order 13577 (76
Fed. Reg. 35,715; relating to establishment of the
SelectUSA Initiative), shall submit to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House
of Representatives a report that includes—
(1) a review of the comments SelectUSA re-
ceived from State-level economic development organi-
zations under section 4;
(2) a description of activities SelectUSA is en-
gaged in to increase foreign direct investment in
semiconductor-related manufacturing and produc-
tion; and
(3) an assessment of strategies SelectUSA may
implement to achieve an increase in such investment
and to help secure the United States supply chain
for semiconductors, including by—
(A) working with other relevant Federal
agencies; and

(B) working with State-level economic de-
velopment organizations and implementing any
strategies or recommendations SelectUSA re-
ceived from those organizations.

SEC. 1406. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS.
No additional funds are authorized to be appro-
priated for the purpose of carrying out this title. The Ex-
ecutive Director of SelectUSA shall carry out this title
using amounts otherwise available to the Executive Direc-

stringent than the needs-based criteria es-

the Secretary, not less frequently than an-
nually, data for purposes of paragraph

waiver under this subsection to provide
home and community-based services to in-
dividuals described in clause (iii) was in ef-
fect—

fined by the Secretary) of such serv-
ices furnished to individuals described
in clause (iii), broken down by type of
service;

munity demographics, and local economic fac-
tors (as defined by the Secretary) affect the
cost of providing maternity, labor, and delivery
services at applicable hospitals, including the
cost of services that support the provision of
maternity, labor, and delivery services.

(D) The amounts applicable hospitals are
paid for maternity, labor, and delivery services,
by geographic location and hospital size,
under—
(i) Medicare;
(ii) the State Medicaid program, in-
cluding payment amounts for such services
under fee-for-service payment arrange-
ments and under managed care (as appli-
cable);
(iii) the State CHIP plan, including
payment amounts for such services under
fee-for-service payment arrangements and
under managed care (as applicable); and
(iv) private health insurance.
(E) A comparative payment rate anal-
ysis—
(i) comparing payment rates for ma-
ternity, labor, and delivery services (inclu-
sive of all payments received by applicable
hospitals for furnishing maternity, labor,
and delivery services) under the State
Medicaid fee-for-service program to such
payment rates for such services under
Medicare (as described in section

447.203(b)(3) of title 42, Code of Federal
Regulations), other Federally-funded or
State-funded programs (including, to the
extent data is available, Medicaid managed
care rates), and to the payment rates for
such services, to the extent data is avail-
able, of private health insurers within geo-
graphic areas of the State; and
(ii) analyzing different payment meth-
ods for such services, such as the use of
bundled payments, quality incentives, and
low-volume adjustments.
(F) An evaluation, using such methodology
and parameters established by the Secretary, of
whether each hospital located in the State that
furnishes maternity, labor, and delivery services
is expected to experience in the next 3 years
significant changes in particular expenditures
or types of reimbursement for maternity, labor,
and delivery services.
(3) APPLICABLE HOSPITAL DEFINED.—For
purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘applicable
hospital’’ means any hospital located in a State that
meets either of the following criteria:

(A) The hospital provides labor and deliv-
ery services and more than 50 percent of the
hospital’s births (in the most recent year for
which such data is available) are financed by
the Medicaid program or CHIP.
(B) The hospital—
(i) is located in a rural area (as de-
fined by the Federal Office of Rural
Health Policy for the purpose of rural
health grant programs administered by
such Office);
(ii) based on the most recent 2 years
of data available (as determined by the
Secretary), furnished services for less than
an average of 300 births per year; and
(iii) provides labor and delivery serv-
ices.
(4) ASSISTANCE TO SMALL HOSPITALS IN COM-
PILING COST INFORMATION.—There are appro-
priated to the Secretary for fiscal year 2025,
$10,000,000 for the purpose of providing grants and
technical assistance to a hospital described in para-
graph (3)(B) to enable such hospital to compile de-
tailed information for use in the State studies re-

quired under paragraph (1), to remain available
until expended.
(5) HHS REPORT ON STATE STUDIES.—For
each year in which a State is required to conduct a
study under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall issue,
not later than 12 months after the date on which
the State submits to the Secretary the data de-
scribed in such paragraph, a publicly available re-
port that compiles and details the results of such
study and includes the information described in
paragraph (2).
(b) HHS REPORT ON NATIONAL DATA COLLECTION
FINDINGS.—Not later than 3 years after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Con-
gress, and make publicly available, a report analyzing the
first studies conducted by States under subsection (a)(1),
including recommendations for improving data collection
on the cost of providing maternity, labor, and delivery
services.
(c) IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING.—In addition to the
amount appropriated under subsection (a)(4), there are
appropriated, out of any funds in the Treasury not other-
wise obligated, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2025, to remain

Human Services for purposes of implementing this sec-
tion.

pharmacies, the determination of retail
survey prices of the national average drug
acquisition cost for covered outpatient
drugs that represent a nationwide average

State shall require that any retail community
pharmacy or applicable non-retail pharmacy in
the State that receives any payment, reimburse-
ment, administrative fee, discount, rebate, or
other price concession related to the dispensing
of covered outpatient drugs to individuals re-
ceiving benefits under this title, regardless of
whether such payment, reimbursement, admin-
istrative fee, discount, rebate, or other price
concession is received from the State or a man-
aged care entity or other specified entity (as
such terms are defined in section
1903(m)(9)(D)) directly or from a pharmacy
benefit manager or another entity that has a
contract with the State or a managed care enti-
ty or other specified entity (as so defined), shall
respond to surveys conducted under this para-
graph.

‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to clauses
(ii), (iii), and (iv), the Secretary shall en-
force the provisions of this paragraph with
respect to a pharmacy through the estab-
lishment of civil money penalties applicable
to a retail community pharmacy or an ap-
plicable non-retail pharmacy.
‘‘(ii) BASIS FOR PENALTIES.—The
Secretary shall impose a civil money pen-
alty established under this subparagraph

on a retail community pharmacy or appli-
cable non-retail pharmacy if—
‘‘(I) the retail pharmacy or appli-
cable non-retail pharmacy refuses or
otherwise fails to respond to a request
for information about prices in con-
nection with a survey under this sub-
section;
‘‘(II) knowingly provides false in-
formation in response to such a sur-
vey; or
‘‘(III) otherwise fails to comply
with the requirements established
under this paragraph.

penalty established under this sub-
paragraph may be assessed with re-
spect to each violation, and with re-
spect to each non-compliant retail
community pharmacy (including a
pharmacy that is part of a chain) or
non-compliant applicable non-retail
pharmacy (including a pharmacy that

is part of a chain), in an amount not
to exceed $100,000 for each such vio-
lation.
‘‘(II) CONSIDERATIONS.—In de-
termining the amount of a civil money
penalty imposed under this subpara-
graph, the Secretary may consider the
size, business structure, and type of
pharmacy involved, as well as the type
of violation and other relevant factors,
as determined appropriate by the Sec-
retary.
‘‘(iv) RULE OF APPLICATION.—The
provisions of section 1128A (other than
subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a
civil money penalty under this subpara-
graph in the same manner as such provi-
sions apply to a civil money penalty or pro-
ceeding under section 1128A(a).
‘‘(I) LIMITATION ON USE OF APPLICABLE
NON-RETAIL PHARMACY PRICING INFORMA-
TION.—No State shall use pricing information
reported by applicable non-retail pharmacies
under subparagraph (A)(ii) to develop or inform

payment methodologies for retail community
pharmacies.’’;

including payment rates and methodologies for
determining ingredient cost reimbursement
under managed care entities or other specified
entities (as such terms are defined in section
1903(m)(9)(D)),’’ after ‘‘under this title’’; and

transfer prices and related party transactions

may influence the costs reported by pharmacies
that are affiliates (as defined in subsection
(k)(14)) or are owned by, controlled by, or re-
lated under a common ownership structure with
a wholesaler, distributor, or other entity that
acquires covered outpatient drugs relative to
costs reported by pharmacies not affiliated with
such entities. The Inspector General shall pro-
vide periodic updates to Congress on the results
of such studies, as appropriate, in a manner
that does not disclose trade secrets or other
proprietary information.
‘‘(B) APPROPRIATION.—There is appro-
priated to the Inspector General of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, out of
any money in the Treasury not otherwise ap-
propriated, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2025, to

by subsection (a).
(2) INCLUSION OF PHARMACY TYPE INDICA-
TORS.—The guidance published under paragraph (1)

payments set as a percentage of a prescription
drug’s price to advantage formulary selection,
distribution, or purchasing of prescription drugs
with higher prices.
(E) Notable differences, if any, in the use
and level of price-based compensation struc-
tures over time and between different market
segments, such as under part D of title XVIII

not be construed to relieve or limit a responsible plan fidu-
ciary from the duty to monitor the practices of any covered
service provider that contracts with the applicable covered

ment Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C.

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29

‘‘(7)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E),
if the sponsor of an approved application for a reference
product, as defined in section 351(i) of the Public Health
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(i)) (referred to in this para-
graph as the ‘reference product sponsor’), brings an action
for infringement under this section against an applicant

ferred to in this paragraph as the ‘subsection (k) appli-
cant’), the reference product sponsor may assert in the
action a total of not more than 20 patents of the type
described in subparagraph (B), not more than 10 of which

product.

patents described in paragraph (3)(A) of section

‘‘(I) have an actual filing date of more
than 4 years after the date on which the ref-
erence product is approved; or
‘‘(II) include a claim to a method in a
manufacturing process that is not used by the
reference product sponsor.
‘‘(C) The court in which an action described in sub-
paragraph (A) is brought may increase the number of pat-
ents limited under that subparagraph—
‘‘(i) if the request to increase that number is
made without undue delay; and
‘‘(ii)(I) if the interest of justice so requires; or
‘‘(II) for good cause shown, which—
‘‘(aa) shall be established if the subsection
(k) applicant fails to provide information re-
quired section 351(k)(2)(A) of the Public
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)(2)(A))

that would enable the reference product sponsor
to form a reasonable belief with respect to
whether a claim of infringement under this sec-
tion could reasonably be asserted; and
‘‘(bb) may be established—
‘‘(AA) if there is a material change to
the biological product (or process with re-
spect to the biological product) of the sub-
section (k) applicant that is the subject of
the application;

the supplemental list described in section

have issued before the date specified in

delay in the issuance of the patent, as de-
scribed in paragraph (1) of section 154(b)
and subject to the limitations under para-
graph (2) of such section 154(b); or
‘‘(CC) for another reason that shows
good cause, as determined appropriate by
the court.

‘‘(D) In determining whether good cause has been
shown for the purposes of subparagraph (C)(ii)(II), a
court may consider whether the reference product sponsor
has provided a reasonable description of the identity and
relevance of any information beyond the subsection (k) ap-
plication that the court believes is necessary to enable the
court to form a belief with respect to whether a claim of
infringement under this section could reasonably be as-
serted.
‘‘(E) The limitation imposed under subparagraph
(A)—
‘‘(i) shall apply only if the subsection (k) appli-
cant completes all actions required under paragraphs
(2)(A), (3)(B)(ii), (5), (6)(C)(i), (7), and (8)(A) of
section 351(l) of the Public Health Service Act (42

that claims, with respect to a biological product, a
method for using that product in therapy, diagnosis,
or prophylaxis, such as an indication or method of
treatment or other condition of use.’’.

section (a) shall apply with respect to an application sub-

sonally identifiable information, and to
provide information that is a reliable indi-
cator of performance achievement.

‘‘(B) PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.—The per-
formance criteria to receive and maintain eligi-
bility for a program under this section are each

responding local area, but may not—
‘‘(i) require any information or appli-
cation from the provider that is not re-
quired for such eligibility; or

ment with respect to any criterion not list-
ed in subparagraph (B).

amount that the provider would have oth-
erwise received under section 133(b) for
the provision of training services by such
program to such participant; and

RANGEMENT.—A provider of a program receiv-
ing an employer-sponsored designation under

participants (calculated as the percentage
of program participants in unsubsidized
employment during the second quarter
after exit from the program) of not less
than 70 percent;
‘‘(iii) median earnings of program
participants who are in unsubsidized em-
ployment during the second quarter after

employment in an occupation related
to the program, to the extent prac-

‘‘(6) ELIGIBLE PROVIDER.—In this section,
other than subsection (i), a provider of an eligible
program under this section shall be considered to be
identified as an eligible provider of training services.
‘‘(c) PROCEDURES.—
‘‘(1) APPLICATION PROCEDURES.—The proce-
dures established under subsection (a) shall identify
the application process for a provider of training
services (for a program offered by the provider) to
become eligible to receive funds provided under sec-
tion 133(b) for the provision of training services.
That process shall be implemented in a manner that
minimizes the financial and administrative burden
on the provider and shall not require the submission
of information in excess of the information required
to determine a program’s eligibility under para-
graphs (1), (2), and (5) of subsection (b). The pro-
cedures shall identify the respective roles of the
State and local areas in receiving and reviewing the

applications and in making determinations of such
eligibility based on the criteria, information require-
ments, and procedures established under this sec-
tion. The procedures shall also establish a process,
for a provider of training services to appeal a denial
or revocation or termination of eligibility under this
section, that includes an opportunity for a hearing
and prescribes appropriate time limits to ensure
prompt resolution of the appeal.
‘‘(2) APPROVAL.—A Governor shall make a de-
termination of such eligibility with respect to a pro-
gram for which the provider is seeking eligibility
under this section not later than 30 days after re-
ceipt of an application submitted by such provider
consistent with the procedures in paragraph (1).
‘‘(3) RENEWAL PROCEDURES.—The procedures

training services that is eligible under this sec-
tion for a program year with respect to an eligi-
ble program, but that does not provide the in-
formation described in subsection (b)(5) with
respect to such program for such program year
(including information on performance nec-
essary to determine if the program meets the

ance criteria to maintain eligibility), the pro-
vider shall be ineligible under this section with
respect to such program for the program year
after the program year for which the provider
fails to provide such information.
‘‘(B) FAILURE TO MEET PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA.—
‘‘(i) FIRST YEAR.—The provider of an
eligible program that has received eligi-
bility under subsection (c)(2) for a pro-
gram year but fails to meet the minimum
levels of performance on the performance
criteria described in subsection (b)(2) for
the most recent program year for which
performance data on such criteria are

available shall be notified of such failure by
the Governor.
‘‘(ii) SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR.—A
program that fails to meet the minimum
levels of performance for a second consecu-
tive program year shall be ineligible under
this section with respect to such program

consecutive program year and until the
program meets the minimum levels of per-
formance.
‘‘(iii) REAPPLICATION.—A provider
that loses eligibility under this subpara-
graph with respect to a program may re-
apply to receive eligibility for the program
according to the procedures described in
this subparagraph if the program meets
the minimum levels of performance de-
scribed in clause (i), for the most recent
program year for which performance data
on the performance criteria are available.
‘‘(C) REPEATED FAILURE.—A program for
which the Governor revokes eligibility under
subparagraph (A) or (B)—

‘‘(i) 2 times shall be determined ineli-
gible under this section by the Governor
for a period of at least 2 years;
‘‘(ii) 3 times shall be determined ineli-
gible under the section by the Governor for
a period of at least 5 years; and
‘‘(iii) more than 3 times shall be de-
termined ineligible under this section by
the Governor for a period of at least 10
years.
‘‘(5) CONTINUITY OF TRAINING SERVICES.—A
provider of a program for which the Governor re-
vokes eligibility under paragraph (4) shall—
‘‘(A) be prohibited from enrolling any new
participants whose participation would be fund-
ed under section 133(b) in the program and
from receiving any payments from funds pro-
vided under section 133(b) for any participants

of revocation or termination until and unless
the Governor determines that the provider has
demonstrated that the program offered by the
provider has met the requirements for the pro-
vider to gain the opportunity to reapply for eli-

gibility under the procedure described in para-
graph (4)(B)(iii); and

in a program for which eligibility is revoked by the
Governor under this subsection shall notify such par-
ticipants that such program no longer meets the
State’s requirements for eligible providers of train-
ing services under this Act and that the participant
has the opportunity to continue receiving training
services from such program, in order to complete the
program.
‘‘(7) MULTISTATE PROVIDERS.—The proce-
dures established under subsection (a) shall specify
the process for any provider of training services of-
fering a program that is eligible under this section
in a first State to establish eligibility under this sec-
tion in an additional State, which shall, to the extent
practicable, minimize financial and administrative
burdens on any such provider by authorizing the

provider to submit the same application materials
and information to the Governor of the additional
State that was accepted by the Governor granting
the provider’s eligibility in the first State, as long as
the program meets the applicable State requirements
for such eligibility established under subsection (b).
‘‘(8) ONLINE PROVIDERS.—The procedures es-
tablished under subsection (a) shall apply to a pro-
vider that delivers training services exclusively on-
line. If a participant chooses a provider that delivers
training services exclusively online and is not located
in the State of the local area that approved such
training services for the participant in accordance
with section 133(c)(3)(A)(i), such provider shall be
ineligible to receive payment for such participant
from funds allotted to such State under section 132
unless such provider is on the list of eligible pro-
viders of training services described in subsection (d)
for such State with respect to the program involved.
‘‘(d) LIST AND INFORMATION TO ASSIST PARTICI-
PANTS IN CHOOSING PROVIDERS.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In order to facilitate and
assist participants in choosing employment and
training activities and in choosing providers of train-

credential navigation feature that allows partici-
pants and the public to search a list of such
recognized postsecondary credentials, and the
providers awarding and programs leading to
such a credential, which shall include, with re-
spect to each such credential (aggregated for all
participants in the State that have received

such credential through an eligible program
under this section or through, as applicable, an-
other program carried out under this title)—
‘‘(i) the information required under
subsection (b)(5)(B)(i)(II); and
‘‘(ii) the performance of participants
with respect to the indicators (relating to
employment and earnings outcomes) de-
scribed in subclauses (I) through (III) of
section 116(b)(2)(i).
‘‘(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing

sonally identifiable information about an indi-
vidual participant.

ance to a State on establishing a website that
meets the requirements of paragraph (4); and

ments of this subsection, no personally identifiable
information regarding a student, including a Social
Security number, student identification number, or

compliance with section 444 of the General Edu-
cation Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g).

tablishing, under this section, criteria, procedures, and the
list of eligible providers described in subsection (d), the

Governor shall provide an opportunity for interested mem-
bers of the public to make recommendations and submit
comments regarding such criteria, procedures, and list.
‘‘(f) PROVIDER PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Governor shall estab-
lish a system of performance incentive payments to
be awarded to eligible providers in addition to the
amount paid under section 133(b) to such providers

under subsection (b)(2);
‘‘(B) serve a significantly higher number of
individuals with barriers to employment com-
pared to training providers offering similar

benefits) as determined by the State or the
local board.

ments to providers established under paragraph (1)
shall be awarded to eligible providers from funds re-

rected skills development, incumbent worker train-
ing, internships, paid or unpaid work experience op-
portunities, and transitional employment as nec-

essary to enable the use of State administrative data
to generate such performance information as the
Governor may require, and use the information to
determine whether the providers meet such perform-
ance criteria as the Governor may require. The one-
stop operator shall disseminate information identi-
fying such providers that meet the criteria as eligible
providers, and the performance information, through
the one-stop delivery system. Providers determined
to meet the criteria shall be considered to be identi-
fied as eligible providers of training services.
‘‘(j) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.—The Governor may
apply to the Secretary for technical assistance, as de-
scribed in section 168(c), for purposes of carrying out the
